\# Design Decisions



Prepared by Moses



\##  Blue/Green Routing

I used Nginx to route traffic between two Node.js services:

\- `node-blue` on port 3001

\- `node-green` on port 3002



Routing is controlled via Nginx config files (`blue.conf`, `green.conf`), allowing easy switching without downtime.



\##  Chaos Failover

A backup server is configured in `backup.conf` to handle traffic if both primary services fail. This simulates resilience in production environments.



\##  Docker Compose

All services are orchestrated using `docker-compose.yml`, with environment variables defined in `.env.example`. This ensures portability and easy setup.



\##  CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`) automatically builds and tests the setup on every push to `main`. It checks routing and service availability.



\##  Container Registry

Images are tagged and pushed to GHCR for remote deployment and grading. This avoids the need for local Docker installation.



\##  Why This Approach?

\- Blue/Green ensures zero-downtime deployments

\- Nginx provides flexible routing and failover

\- Docker Compose simplifies orchestration

\- CI/CD ensures reliability and automation
